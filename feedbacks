1) Erboto Tazabekov's feedback: 'The game done really well, the real results of efforts are visible. Not only the mechanics of
original game are the same, but also the graphics, and the textures are so. Honestly, if I was told to find differences between
Azizkhan's game and the original one, I probably wouldn't.'
